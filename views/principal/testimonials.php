                            I was very happy with Jose Barrera at Westside Home Inspections (he’s a general contractor, so much more knowledgeable than most inspectors).  Also very high integrity!.

                              I found Jose, at westside home inspections, just randomly online via a basic google search. I certainly was taking a chance without any referral, but to my surprise Jose turned up on time, was very professional and did a thorough home inspection. I asked many questions, took notes and learned a lot from the overall process . I believe his price was fair and within the norm. He provided a complete evaluation with detailed major, minor and negligible problems.
In short, I certainly was very satisfied with choosing Jose at westside home inspections

                              I am very happy with the services I received from Westside Home inspections! Jose, was very  professional and prepared. I wish I had known of him earlier. He was honest and helpful and did his best to put our mind at ease. I recommend him for all your inspection needs.

I really like this guy. I hired him to do a mold inspection. Scheduling was easy. He was punctual, professional, and courteous. He took the trouble to check for leaks and moisture around all the faucets and drains, although that was not required for a mold inspection. I misunderstood the fee agreement and mistakenly overpaid him. He called me later in the day to notify me of my error. I sent him a check for the proper amount and he destroyed the incorrect check. I would have full confidence in Jose to perform any of the many professional services he offers, and is qualified and certified to do. I wish our home inspector had been so thorough and professional.                          </p>

I am very pleased with Westside Home Inspections!  Jose Luis is very thorough, knowledgeable and did a professional job. He takes pride in doing a great job and that’s as good as it gets.  He went out of his local area to inspect my future home, which I’m very grateful for. It gave me peace of mind to know the condition of the house before I went through with the purchase.  I would highly recommend WESTSIDE HOME INSPECTIONS.  Thank you very much Jose Luis!!
