                <p class="text-team mt-4" style="">
Welcome to Westside Home Inspections! I'm Jose Luis Barrera and I'm proud to offer expert property inspections in Los Angeles for home buyers, home sellers, and home owners.              </p>
              <p class=" text-team" style="">
Westside Home Inspections is my personal business, not a franchise operation or part of a large company more interested in quantity over quality. As owner, I focus all my attention on each individual inspection and on doing the best possible work for each client. Rather than creating on-site reports, which simply take a cookie cutter approach, I take the time to add important details unique to each individual property.
              </p>
              <p class=" text-team" style="">
Since California does not require home inspectors to be licensed or certified, it is up to you, the consumer, to make sure the inspector you hire is qualified. I am both a certified home inspector and a licensed general contractor, you can rely on the quality of my work 100%.

With more than 25 years of experience in home improvement and home inspection throughout Los Angeles County, I am ready to give you a rooftop-to-foundation report that's detailed, objective and easy to understand.
